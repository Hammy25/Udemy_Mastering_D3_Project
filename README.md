# Mastering D3.js Course Final Project

The final project of the course is a corporate dashboard to view sales in the year 2017.

The virtual company is known a FreedomCorp. The company sells wholesale goods to small businesses around the country. They sell bulk orders of electronics, household appliances, construction materials and furniture, to different distributors around the country.

The repository contains the code I used to implement the dashboard.
